## Semantic Memory

Nexus builds a deep understanding of your world through advanced semantic memory. It learns from your interactions, preferences, and workflows to become truly personalized to your needs.

### Key Features:
- **Contextual Understanding**: Grasps the nuances of your work environment
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves as it interacts with you
- **Personal Knowledge Base**: Builds a comprehensive model of your world

## Local Models

Your data stays on your machine. Nexus can run entirely locally, ensuring your privacy and security while maintaining high performance. If you need extra performance from commerical LLMs, Nexus can redact any critical or sensitive information before submitting any of your content to the Internet.
