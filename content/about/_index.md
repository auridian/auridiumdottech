heading : "Auridium Technologies: life-affirming augmentation through tech"
description : "
Auridium is building Nexus, a private AI system for offloading cognitive overhead — starting with memory, tasks, and life coordination.  We strive to create a world in which you can store your memory on your hardware, and use whatever systems you want, rather than be purely locked into proprietary cloud platforms. We will NEVER sell user data.

Nexus integrates with your existing workflows (journaling, calendars, documents) and helps you turn passive notes into actionable structure. We’re creating a persistent semantic memory layer you own, with agents that assist you in the background. We believe that "chat" is not the future of AI. Instead, it should be seamless, acting on your behalf.

Nexus is currently in early alpha stage. Stay tuned for further opportunities to get involved. 

Auridium Technologies started off as a technology contracting company for mechanical automation, process scale up, and mechanical amplification of labor. It now serves as the vessel for primarily-software activities of owner/founder Milo J. Hooper."
