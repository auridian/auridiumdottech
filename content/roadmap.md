## In Development

### Supervisor
Your AI co-pilot that learns how you think and works the way you do.

**Core Systems:**
- Learns your priorities, not just your tasks
- Adapts your workflows in real-time
- Tracks progress your way
- Understands commands in plain language
- Keeps you on track without getting in your way

### Nexus Dashboard
An adaptive, interactive, retro-cyberpunk theme dashboard for interfacing with your Nexus.

**Features:**
- Live system monitoring with *style*
- User interface adapts to your use cases
- Drag-and-drop widget customization
- Themes that don't feel like a hospital or LinkedIn
- Runs on anything with a screen

### Neural Links
Hack Nexus to its core. Make it truly yours.

**Powers:**
- Hook into any tool/system/workflow you use already
- Self-extending: identifies missing capabilities and tools and generates them
- Share workflows on the Nexus Market (if you choose)


## The Path Forward

### Phase 1: Epoch (March-April 02025)
- Core semantic memory system and Epoch creation
- Basic local model integration for messy input processing with limited data types (logseq, caldav)
- Goal, project, belief, observation, and entity tracking in conceptual and temporal dimensions
- Basic agent loops began, first tools generated, testing tool creation.
- Basic dashboard functional
- Begin Nexus Alpha testing program with first cohort

### Phase 2: nex/acc part 1 (May-Summer 02025)

- Raise funds to grow private LLM outsourcing option, fund further development
- Create optional marketplace / repository for Nexi and users to share integrations and save time / effort integrating
- First paying customers, MVP launched if not before
- Feedback from Nexus Alpha first cohort integrated; begin second cohort
- Build community feedback / fora / etc.

### Phase 3: nex/acc part 2 (Fall 02025 and beyond)

- The future is hard to predict. An early Nexus will probably have hit AGI by then. Sit back and enjoy the ride. 
- (A whole lot of TBD)
- Enterprise version
- Light mode
